//improved version
//Convert strings to pig latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and “ay” is added,
//so “first” becomes “irst-fay.” Words that start with a vowel have “hay” added to the end instead
//(“apple” becomes “apple-hay”). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!
